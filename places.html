  Cuba is a large island with a variety of different types of cities and landscapes. This is not your typical tropical island getaway where the entire land is made of sand and the point of being there is to drink fruity drinks and lay on the beach while you burn. The country's total length is roughly 1300km full of beautiful landscape and history. Hiking, rock climbing, rafting, diving, boating, tobacco plantations, horseback riding, nightlife, and museums are all activities the Cuban people would love to help you experience. You don't need an official tour. Cubans are extrememly friendly and are passionate about their culture and want to share that with you. People will come up to you on the street and offer to take you places. Listen to them, talk to them and go with them. Don't be afraid of the unknown and you will get to do things you didn't know you wanted to do.
