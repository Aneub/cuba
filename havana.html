  <h1>Havana</h1>
  <p>Havana's streets are lined with beautiful old, colorful buildings, vintage cars, tiny hooded motocycle cabs and the occasional horse and buggy. There is plenty to do and see so be ready for whatever comes your way! Wander down the street without a plan. Maybe this ends up as a nice walk but more than likely you will stumble upon things to do you didn't know you wanted to do.</p>	
  
  <h2>Take a walk down El Malecon</h2>
  <p>El Malecon is a paved road that takes you along the coast where you can enjoy the ocean waves crashing against the shore. It is similar to Chicago's Lake Shore drive. Stop in a gas station and grab an ice cream for the walk or sit outside at Hotel Nacional and drink a fresh mojito and watch the sun set over the ocean.</p>
  
  <h2>Find a street party</h2>
  <p>Talk to some locals and follow them to a party in the street. These are not advertised but are known by word of mouth. You will hear the music and the crowd getting louder as you walk down the small cobblestne streets until you round the corner and find the street packed with people dancing and singing along with the band. Duck into one of the doors and you may find a small bar, grab a drink and head outside to watch the band. Look around and enjoy all the street art that surrounds you. Let you eyes follow the art up the buildings and notice residents hanging out their windows and on balconies also enjoying the party.</p>
  
  <h2>Go salsa dancing</h2>
  <p>Take a class or just go to the bars and watch others. There are plenty of spots for a great night out. Havana stays open all night! A couple of the popular places are Casa de la Musica and Cafe Cantante but the best way to enjoy the city is to just wander down the street until a place pops up in front of you, you hear the music inside and you take that opportunity and go inside. Keep an open mind and stumble upon something great!</p>
  
  <h2>Check out some history</h2>
  <p>Old Havana is the core of the original city and an UNESCO World Heritage site. It was founded in 1519 and has 5 large plazas each with their own style. Old havana is defined by the old city walls. Morro Castle is the old fortress guarding the entrance to Havana Bay. It was built in 1589 in response to raids. NOw you can go inside and check out the exhibiions. Museum of the Revolution became a museum after the Cuban Revoluion and is located in the old Presidential Palace. These are just a few places amongst many more!</p>
