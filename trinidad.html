  <h1>Trinidad</h1>
  <p>Be ready for a long night out in this lively little town. Once you step foot in this town you are transported back to the 1500's. Large cobblestone streets, dogs running across the rooftops, horse and shays trotting down the street, meat hanging in windows, and well preserved buildings. There are a a bunch of bars, restaurants and live music venues. As you walk to each you can pick up a mojito from one of the many stands that pop up at night. The streets can get confusing so you might get lost but at least everyone is friendly and getting lost at 4am isn't a cause for concern</p>
  
  <h2>Wander the streets</h2>
  <p>The town is something to see. As described above it really takes you back to the 1500's and it's fun to walk around and observe the lives in the community. Talk to people and let them share with you something they really enjoy. Watch the kids play futbol in the street, see someone riding their horse and shay home with a cart full of vegetables, see someone chopping up a pig in their window or people playing a game of chess on a table near the plaza. The people are welcoming and full of life so go outside and be a part of it.</p>
  
  <h2>Go out all night</h2>
  <p>There are a bunch of places to choose from. Or don't choose and go to all of them! La Casa de Musica is a large outdoor salsa venue/bar right in the center. They have live bands and people dancing salsa in the front. Anybody can join or just sit on the stone steps and enjoy watching. It gets crowded and does have a small cover charge but it is fun. In the same area you will find multiple other bars. Some have live music and some don't, some are crowded and some are low key so there's something for everyone. If you walk a short 5 minutes outside of town up a small hill you will find yourself at the entrance to a cave. Inside this cave there is a dance club with modern club music and lights. The cave is a cave. They only added the floor. This place is unlike any other. Hopefully by the time the bars close you have met some friends because many people will head over to the beach for afterhours.</p>
  
  <h2>Go to the beach</h2>
  <p> Maybe you made it to the beach late at night and maybe not but either way you should go to the beach during the daytime. The sand is white, the water is warm and clear and the sun is hot. Someone will make you a drink in a coconut or you can go to the restaurant and get food and drinks. There are people on the beach offering different excursions like snorkeling. It's beautiful and relaxing.
