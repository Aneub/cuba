  <h1>10 Cultural Observations You May Find Interesting!</h1><br>
  <ol>
  <li>There are 2 currencies in Cuba: 1 is for tourists and 1 is for locals. Tourists cannot get local currency and locals can only get tourist currency if they get it from a local. They were worth different amounts and are used to buy different things</li>
  <li>A side job for many locals is being a personal tour guide for tourists. They will take you to do the things you want to do so they can earn the tourist peso</li>
  <li>You can count on the airline to be late but always get you there at some point. They won't rebook you, they will get you to the plane as soon as it gets to the airport. If you have a connection, give yourself additional time and then some</li>
  <li>Sometimes the currency exchange at the Havana airport doesn't have enough money to give out. You may have to wait.</li>
  <li>Cubans love fresh juice. You will drink a lot of it</li>
  <li>It's wise to bring your own roll of toilet paper</li>
  <li>You share the road with all forms of transportation from cars to bicycles, to horse and shays</li>
  <li>There are no billboards advertising products and services, only billboards with quotes from Castro and Guevara</li>
  <li>Shopping is not a main activity. You won't see inviting advertisements or store fronts that make you want to go look around. Don't expect that if you forget something you will easily be able to get it there.</li>
  <li>The Havana zoo has Hyenas</li>
