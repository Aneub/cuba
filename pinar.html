  <h1>Pinar Del Rio/Vinales</h1>
  <p>Come to Pinar Del Rio for tobacco and Vinales for the gorgeous scenery! Vinales is said to be one of Cuba's embelmatic landscapes. The background picture is of Vinales valley. You don't necessarily need an official tour, just talk with someone on the street and they will help you out.</p>
  
  <h2>Learn about tobacco production</h2>
  <p>There are 2 ways to experience tobacco/cigar production here. Pinar del Rio has a government run tobacco manufacturing facitility which you can tour for $5. You walk into the facility and there is a small walkway for tourists. You will see rows of workers sitting there just rolling cigars. The facility is not modern and appears that it hasn't changed since it was built. The workers are not talking, there are no TV's and no music playing. Just silence as they sit and roll the cigars. You are not allowed to take pictures inside. The other way is to see an actual tobacco plantation. There are no "official" tours. While you walk down the street people will come up to you and offer you a tobacco plantation tour. Go with them. They will take you out of the city and to a farm where they will show you the fields where the tobacco is grown and large barns where the leaves are drying. They will give you a detailed explanation of tobacco and cigar rolling, while rolling one in front of you. You even get to smoke one while you listen. It's worth it to see both sides</p>
  
  <h2>Visit a sugar cane plantation</h2> 	
  <p>Cubans are passionate about their fresh fruits and sugar cane and would love to make you a delicious drink right from their farm. Visit a farm and they will show you what they grow and what makes it great. Then they will make you a rum drink!</p>
  
  <h2>Canoe down the Cueva del Indio</h2>
  <p>It's an underground river. It's not very long but that's pretty cool</p>
  
  <h2>Explore the Landscape</h2>
  <p>A local resident can take you horseback riding through vinales valley. You will get to see the gorgeous landscape and beautiful community. Hiking is also an option. There are ancient geological formations and mountains as well as underground caverns, rivers and a coastline good for diving and boating. You will find a variety of landscapes, vegetation and life.</p>
